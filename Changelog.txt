0.5.0:

New:
-Added update checker (one of the most important things a game needs)
-Added analog sensitivity to gamepad
-Widescreen resolution (sorry about that)
-Skippable intro (and that)
-Smaller hitbox. Now one pixel right in the center of your window
-Burst spawns: 
	--Besides standard formations, you will have a 10% chance of spawning a 
		bunch of enemies (up to level^1.5). This'll bump up the difficulty,
		while also making the later levels go faster.
-Decided to begin keeping detailed changelog (very important, don't put this off)

-You now visit the store right after killing the boss
-Boss health increases exponentially instead of linearly

	immediately explode after a second
